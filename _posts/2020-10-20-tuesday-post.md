Call me *Ishmael*. Some years ago - *never mind how long precisely* - having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interst me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circuation.

Whenever I find myself growing grim about teh mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, adn methodically knocking people's hats off - then I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This ismy substitue pitol and ball.
